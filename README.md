# OctopusDeploy.CCTray

This is a small library that uses the OctopusDeploy API to get the
status of a given project and convert it to a CCTray compatiable XML.

The XML implements the Multiple Project Summary Reporting Standard described at
http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CI/Multiple+Project+Summary+Reporting+Standard
